As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <reason>.

As a user, I want a simple user interface so that I can play tic-tac-toe without having to read a user manual.

As a user, I want a personal account so that I can look back on the games I've played.

As a developer, I want a modular script structure so that I can easily debug, test, and refactor parts of my code.

As a user, I want a sleek and minimalist design so that nothing distracts me from the engaging gameplay.

As a user, I want a second-player login feature so that I can play with friends.

As a user, I want a signout option so that I am not trapped for eternity in an endless hell of tic-tac-toe-playing.
